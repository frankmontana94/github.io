    <p class ="para-font">William Henry "Bill" Gates III was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28th, 1955. He is best known for being the co-founder of Microsoft and being one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. As of January 2017, his net worth reached 88.5 billion dollars. Gates started his interest in computers and computer software as a teen in high school. After he graduated, he attended Harvard University, but Gates dropped out to further pursue his passion in software development.  In the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/ofnote/06-22usatoday.mspx"> Bill Gates note<a/> link, Gates explains how the microprocessor increased a computer's potential. The microprocessor needed software, so Gates and a former Harvard collegue, Paul Allen,  had the vision to create software for the microprocessors and start up their business, Micro-Soft.
